execv()
will look at system path for the program


recv_size = recv()


CHECK THIS


while (recv_size == BUFFER_SIZE && strcmp(reply[BUFFER_SIZE - 1], "terminating character") != 0)
{
    recv_size = recv()
}

GET THE SERVER TO SEND THE TERMINATING CHAR
maybe make a unicode character


RUN COMMAND

opendir command or something like that
lets you iterate through all files

i think the client is just sending the first arg
